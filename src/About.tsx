          {/* As a lifelong musician, before tech I taught guitar and voice, ran a rehearsal studio, and booked concerts in NYC and beyond.

In 2020, I took a leap and trained in modern app development at Fullstack Academy. I quickly absorbed new concepts, while bringing ambitious ideas and a positive attitude to every challenge.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually doing yoga, testing out a new recipe, or writing a musical parody on guitar.
