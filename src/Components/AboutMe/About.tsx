In 2020, I took a leap and trained in modern app development at Fullstack Academy. I quickly absorbed new concepts, while bringing ambitious ideas and a positive attitude to every challenge.

I’m a software engineer specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I’m focused on building accessible, human-centered products at Upstatement.
I am a Product and UX Designer! I work at the intersection of curiosity, reasoning and imagination, which guide me to uncover insights, (re)frame problems and craft meaningful, future-oriented solutions.
I am passionate about providing solutions to users by building accessible products. */}
          I initially undertook web development as a hobby, soon realising I had a natural aptitude, and an inexhaustible curiosity for how it all
          worked. This developed into full time, self-directed study, employing the work ethic I developed during my years in the catering and
          healthcare industries. I thoroughly enjoy the technical challenge programming presents, developing new skills and implementing them in real
          world applications.
